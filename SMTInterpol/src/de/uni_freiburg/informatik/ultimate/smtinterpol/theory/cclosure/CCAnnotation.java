/**
 * Annotations for congruence-closure theory lemmata.
 * 
 * A theory lemma is annotated with a set of paths and literals on these path.
 * A special role plays the diseq literal, which is the only positive literal
 * in the clause.  In the negated clause this is the disequality that is in
 * conflict with the other equalities.
 * 
 * The main path (index 0) starts and ends with one side of the diseq literal.
 * Every step must either be explained by a literal from the clause 
 * (litsOnPaths != null), or by a congruence, i.e., there are two paths
 * explaining the equality of func and arg terms.  Trivial paths for equal func
 * or arg terms are omitted.
