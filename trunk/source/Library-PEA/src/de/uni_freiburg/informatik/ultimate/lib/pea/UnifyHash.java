/**
 * A UnifyHash is a collection that helps to implement the fly-weight
 * design pattern. It stores a set of weak references to objects,
 * which can be retrieved by a hash code.
 * If you use the fly-weight design pattern consequently, you do not
 * need to override equals or hash code at all, as two objects that
 * equal are always the same. Unfortunatel while you are creating a
 * new object, you need to check, if the same object already existed
 * and therefore have a method to compare for equality and to
 * calculate a hash code for the hash table used in this class.
 * Therefore you have to call the put/remove/unify methods with
 * some hash code calculated from the internal data. Also the
 * unify method is called with a comparator, that checks for
 * equality.
 * The way to use this class is as follows. First follow the
 * fly-weight design pattern and make the class immutable. Make the
 * constructor private so it can't be called from outside the class.
 * Instead add a static method &quot;<code>create</code>&quot; that
 * creates new instances, or reuses old ones that have the same data:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     private static UnifyHash<MyObject> unifyHash;
 *
 *      **
 *      * Create a new instance of MyObject with parameters
 *      * "a" and "child", or returns an already existing one.
 *     public static MyObject create(int a, MyObject child) {
 *        int hashcode = a*0x12345679 + child.hashCode();
 *
 *         * First iterate the object with the same hashcode and
 *         * check if the same object is already present.
 *        Iterator<MyObject> it = unifyHash.iterateHashCode(hashcode);
 *        MyObject o;
 *
 *        try_next: while (it.hasNext()) {
 *            o = it.next();
 *            if (o.a == a && o.child == child) {
 *                return o;
 *            }
 *        }
 *         * Object was not found, create a new one and put it into
 *         * the unify hash.
 *        o = new MyObject(a, child);
 *        unifyHash.put(hashcode, o);
 *        return o;
 *    }
 * </pre>
