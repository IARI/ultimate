/**
 * Interface for automata operations.<br>
 * If possible,
 * <ul>
 * <li>each operation is defined in its own class
 * <li>for every application of the operation a new instance of this class is
 * constructed
 * <li>the result is returned via the {@link #getResult()} method
 * <li>start and end of the operation are reported to the logger using log
 * level <tt>INFO</tt>
 * <li>correctness checks for this operation are implemented in the
 * checkResult method. Whoever executes this operation should add an
 * <blockquote>
 * {@code assert} {@link #checkResult()}
 * </blockquote>
 * in the code.
 * </ul>
 * By convention the constructor of an IOperation has the following parameters.
 * <ul>
 * <li>The fist parameter are the {@link AutomataLibraryServices}. If the operation
 * is executed by the automata script interpreter, the interpreter will use
 * the {@link AutomataLibraryServices} of the current toolchain as an argument.
 * <li>If the IOperation requires a {@link IStateFactory}, the {@link IStateFactory} should
 * be the second parameter. If the second parameter is a {@link IStateFactory}, the
 * automata script interpreter uses a {@link StringFactory} as argument.
 * <li>The remaining parameters of the constructor are the parameters of the
 * operation (i.e., the parameters for which you provide arguments in an
 * .ats file). It is good practice to have a default constructor with a minimal number of arguments, and optionally
 * other constructors with more arguments. The minimal constructor should be considered the default for .ats files.
 * </ul>
